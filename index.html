                            This is a study guide for the UC Berkley coding bootcamp. I built this project to have an
                            additional resource to refer to throughout the duration of the bootcamp. This will help
                            structure my learning so I can better retain the information taught in the bootcamp. Without
                            any
                            prior dev knowledge, this project has allowed me to learn some basics of coding and given me
                            the
                            confidence to know that I can be successful in this field. Additionally, this project has
                            helped
                            me better understand how I learn and can study coding.

                            This project was made to mimic an on-the-job ticket example of refactoring code to make it
                            follow accessibility standards and honor the Scout Rule - meaning leave the code better than
                            it was found. Adjustments were made to the HTML elements along with the cooresponding CSS
                            selectors to "clean" it up without impacting the code's output. Comments were added to all
                            changes to
                            annotate adjustments. Completing this project teaches that code can still have the same
                            outcome even if many paths are taken, but there is always room for improvement.
